// version already has a local tag, either it was pushed (fine, this is a
// normal second release) or it wasn't (the first run's tag/commit is about to

// the underlying commit, but GitHub's smart-HTTP response doesn't always
// include it — parsing only the direct line then compares the tag OBJECT's
