// Tiny in-memory TTL cache for read endpoints. Caching cuts latency and eases
// pressure on rate-limited upstreams. Expired entries are retained (bounded by
// max size) so they can be served as a stale fallback when the upstream is down.
//
// One instance is shared across a client's many endpoints, each storing its
// own shape under its own key (a movie detail, a credits list, a genre map,
// …) — genuinely heterogeneous storage, not one fixed type. So the type
// parameter lives on each method call, not on the class: callers get back
// whatever type their own `compute()`/`value` actually is, instead of every
// caller being forced down to one class-wide type (previously
// `Record<string, unknown>`, which every method had to individually re-widen
// to and callers had to cast back out of).

/**
 * Build a deterministic cache key from a stable resource path (e.g.

 * and sort-order-independent, closing the bug class where a dimension (e.g.
 * region) was silently left out of a key and one request's response leaked
